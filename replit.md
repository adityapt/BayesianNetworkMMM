# Marketing Mix Modeling DAG Builder

## Overview

This application is a marketing mix modeling (MMM) tool that allows users to create and manage causal models through an interactive Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) interface. The application enables marketers to visualize relationships between different marketing channels and outcome metrics, configure parameters like spend, coefficients, and confidence levels, and validate model structures.

- Solution: Modified function to extract base name from timestamp-suffixed IDs and map to appropriate CSV columns
- Added comprehensive debugging logs for node mapping process
- All 3 causal relationships now process correctly: paid_search_spend, social_media_spend, tv_spend → revenue
